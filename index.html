      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the conent inside an element</li>
      <li>Linking the stylesheet to the index requires link rel and href tags. The former being the name of the file, the latter acting as an href link</li>
      <li>Classes = sections or blocks of the document that you want altered or styled. id is for individual changes</li>
      <li>Periods *. are symbols for classes, while *# is the symbol used for ids</li>
      <li>Inside CSS you can change the font-family and font-size, by listing multiple fonts it sets a specific order of fonts with first listed being priority. Size is measured in px</li>
      <li>Line height is used to property sets distance between lines of text, think of double and single spacing as an example</li>
      <li>The * when used in a style sheet before the {} brackets is a unibersal selector that will apply it to the entire sheet</li>
      <li>.display-block sets all elements within class selector to block formatting, .display-inline sets items inline, and .display-none will hide elements within selector</li>
      <li>margin: 0 auto; will center elements</li>
      <li>Margins and padding work with the first number being x and the second number being y (left and right or up and down respectively) using only one number setst he entire space to those dimensions</li>
      <li>Border function sets the borders on all sides</li>
      <li>Static; no alterations, is in normal element flow. Relative; normal element flow but is offset based on provided values. Absolute; removed from normal flow, ex: block element set inline with text. Static; stays in fixed postion on page. ex: ads on websites that follow you despite scrolling down or up.</li>
